# Restaurant-Billing-System

The Restaurant Billing System is a simple project I have used to practise the Object Oriented Concepts I have learnt in Java.

I have applied some java and OOP concepts such as Inheritence and encapsulation.


I used NetBeans IDE for this project. JavaFX is majorly used in this particular project and so some basic understanding of it might be a plus for you.
